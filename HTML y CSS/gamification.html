      <p class="ident">Game elements have been widely added outside games, approach known as <span class="bold">gamification</span>, with the goal of affecting user behavior. The educational domain is where gamification has been researched the most, which is in line with the view that it is an educational innovation that can enhance learning experiences (<span class="colouredtext">Palomino</span> et <span class="dotunderanditalic">al.</span>; <span class="colouredtext">Hernández</span> et
      <!-- dotunderanditalic subraya en puntos y pone en cursiva lo de dentro del span -->
      <span class="dotunderanditalic">al.</span>). Accordingly, empirical evidence supports its positive effect on, for instance, behavioral (<span class="dotunderanditalic">e.g.</span>, class attendance) and cognitive (<span class="dotunderanditalic">e.g.</span>, test performance) learning outcomes. However, researchers often discuss that gamification suffers from the <span class="colouredtext">novelty effect</span>. That is, it leads to positive outcomes when introduced and, as its novelty goes, so does the positive effect.</p>
      <p>This article responds to literature calls by presenting a longitudinal analysis of gamification’s effects on behavioral outcomes over the course of a full semester. Specifically, we analyze data of Brazilian undergraduate students from 14 courses, which were enrolled at the Introductory Programming (<span class="dotunderanditalic">CS1</span>) subject. Gamification is especially valuable in that context because, oftentimes, <span class="dotunderanditalic">CS1</span> is not motivating for <span class="dotunderanditalic">STEM</span> students, which, along with the complexity and substantial practice needed to learn the topic, leads to high drop-out and failure rates). However, while gamification might be a way to encourage positive learning behaviors for <span class="dotunderanditalic">CS1</span>, <span class="dotunderanditalic">STEM</span> learners, there is a lack of empirical evidence on gamification’s long-term effects in that context. We address this gap by answering <span class="colouredtext">How does gamification’s effects on <span class="dotunderanditalic">CS1</span>, <span class="dotunderanditalic">STEM</span> students’ behavioral outcomes change over time?</span></p>

      <p class="ident">Research has provided empirical evidence that users’ perceptions about gamification usage change over time. Koivisto and Hamari found that the more users used a gamified app, the less the perceived benefit they reported was. Similarly, Van Roy and Zaman found learners’ motivations regarding a gamified course decreased throughout the semester, with indication that it then increased towards the end of the semester.</p>
      <p>Some research analyzed changes on gamification’s effect over time within classrooms. Hanus and Fox implemented gamification (using <span class="bold">Badges</span>, <span class="bold">Coins</span>, and a <span class="bold">Leaderboard</span>) to assess its effects on Communications students. Measures were captured three times at every four weeks, for 14 weeks, revealing that the gamification’s impact was nonsignificant at the first time point and negative for the subsequent ones for motivation, satisfaction, and empowerment.</p>

Accordingly, the objective is to answer the following research question:</p>

      <p class="preguntacuadro"><span class="bold">"How does gamification’s effects on <span class="dotunderanditalic">CS1</span>, <span class="dotunderanditalic">STEM</span> students’ behavioral outcomes change over time?"</span></p>
      <p>Therefore, we report results stemming from a quasi-experimental study, conducted in an ecological setting, from 2016 to 2018. The study was conducted in the context of <span class="dotunderanditalic">CS1</span> courses of 14 <span class="dotunderanditalic">STEM</span> undergraduation programs from Federal University of Amazonas (<span class="dotunderanditalic">UFAM</span>).</p>

      <h3>Materials</h3>
      <p class="ident">According to the ecological setting of the study, data was collected through Codebench. It has been developed at <span class="dotunderanditalic">UFAM</span>, Brazil, and since 2016 has been used for supporting teaching the <span class="dotunderanditalic">CS1</span> subject of all <span class="dotunderanditalic">STEM</span> classes of the university.</p>
      <p>Codebench is an online judge, which has been used to help both instructors and students. For instructors, the system contributes by providing a list of programming problems they can use to create assignment lists, to use as activities in their classes. For students, the system offers an <span class="dotunderanditalic">IDE</span> where they can develop solutions for programming problems, suggested by instructors.</p>

      <!-- Creo una lista sin orden debido a que ningun elemento de la lista va antes que otro -->
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Attempts</span>: The number of attempts that a students made. That is, how many times they submitted their solution to the online judge for checking the correctness of the code. Consequently, this measure accounts for both correct and incorrect submissions.</li>
        <li><span class="dotunderanditalic"><span class="bold">IDE Usage</span></span>: The time (in minutes) that a student used the <span class="dotunderanditalic">IDE</span> integrated in the online judge. Note that inactive usage does not count in this metric. Hence, we can see it as a measure of the time a student spent working towards improving their programming skills; that is, practicing to code.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">System Access</span>: How many times a student accessed the online judge. Thereby, it accounts for each time a student logged into the system. Thus, we can see it as a measure of students’ intentions to practice, consult learning materials, and interact with the gamification.</li>

      <h3>Does gamification’s effect change over time?</h3>
      <p>Table 1 presents an overview of the behavioral measures, overall (1-7) and for each time-point, for both experimental conditions. The table shows that participants in the experimental condition (gamified): attempted problems, used the <span class="dotunderanditalic">IDE</span>, and accessed the system 17.5%, 48.6%, and 220% more, respectively, than those with the non-gamified setting.</p>

      <h2 class="longunderline">Conclusions</h2>
      <p class="ident"><span class="bold">Gamification</span> is an educational innovation that has been widely used in several domains. Researchers often advocate that gamification’s impact is positive due to its novelty and that it consequently vanishes as the novelty passes (<span class="dotunderanditalic">i.e.</span>, <span class="colouredtext">the novelty effect</span>). However, little is known about how the gamification effect changes over time, due to the lack of longitudinal studies in this field. Accordingly, recent literature has called for research to address this gap. This study responded to such calls with a 14-week longitudinal study, in which we analyzed the impact of gamification on students’ behavioral outcomes at seven points in time. Specifically, our findings are threefold.</p>
      <p>First, they confirm the effectiveness of the gamification design we proposed to innovate the educational process of teaching programming.</p>
      <p>Second, concerning the novelty effect, we found that novelty:</p>
      <!-- Se crea una lista ordenada porque aquí si tienen un orden los elementos y una sucesión entre el primero y los siguientes -->
      <ol type="i">
        <li>starts to act after four weeks of intervention</li>
        <li>lasts for two to six weeks</li>
        <li>diminishes a moderate effect to null in the worst case</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Third, concerning the familiarization effect, we found that</p>
      <!-- Lo mismo que el comentario de la linea 78 -->
      <ol type="i">
        <li>its positive trend starts between six and ten weeks after the start of the intervention</li>
        <li>it seems to naturally tackle the negative effects of novelty expiration, although it did not restore the positive effect to the level of the initial contribution of the gamification</li>
      </ol>
